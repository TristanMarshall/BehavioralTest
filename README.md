# BehavioralTest
Using Cucumber, CSS, and the Ruby binding to Selenium, write behavioral tests that log into a gmail account and opens up a message in Inbox folder of the account.


#### Due to a shortage of time available to put towards this assessment I was unable to complete the entire assessment. Please keep in mind I have previously been slightly introduced to test driven development with Jasmine. I have never used cucumber, selenium cucumber. 

### What I've taken away: 
	- The general logic of test driven development 
	- The concept of cucumber & its user-friendliness
